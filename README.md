## Introduction

This repository is a collection of algorithmic problems and solutions that I have worked on to enhance my understanding of algorithms and data structures. The goal is to become proficient in these areas to prepare for job interviews and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nixsilvam/algorithm_tasks.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm_tasks

## Algorithms Covered (in progress)

Here is a list of the algorithms and data structures covered in this repository:

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort

### LeetCode Problems
- Two Sum
- Palindrome Number
- Roman to Integer
- Climbing Stairs
- Majority Element
- Missing Number
- Minimum Falling Path Sum
- Unique Number of Occurrences
- Get No Zero Integers
- Array Rank Transform
- Anagram
- Are Numbers Ascending
- Find Winners

## How to Use

Each algorithm and problem is implemented in a separate Python file. To run an example, navigate to the respective file and execute it using Python.

For example, to run the Bubble Sort example:
```bash
python bubble_sort/example.py
```

To run a LeetCode problem solution:
```bash
python leetcode/1_two_sum.py
```
